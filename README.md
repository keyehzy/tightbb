This project has the goal to facilitate the task of specifying and analyzing electronic structures of Hamiltonians embedded in lattices. For example, the underlying structure of [graphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene) is a [hexagonal lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_lattice).
